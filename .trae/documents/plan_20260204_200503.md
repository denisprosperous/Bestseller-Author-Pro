# Fix Supabase Connection & Enable Login

The "Invalid API key" error indicates the application is using an incorrect or outdated Anon Key for your Supabase project. Since I cannot retrieve this key remotely, I will create a **Setup Page** that allows you to input your correct keys directly in the browser. This will fix the connection immediately without needing to edit code or environment variables.

## Steps to Implement

1.  **Create Setup Page (`app/routes/setup-supabase.tsx`)**
    *   A secure page to input `Supabase URL` and `Anon Public Key`.
    *   Saves these values to your browser's LocalStorage (which the app is already configured to read).
    *   Provides a "Test Connection" button to verify the keys work.

2.  **Register Route**
    *   Add `/setup-supabase` to the application routing configuration.

3.  **Deploy**
    *   Deploy the changes to Vercel.

## How You Will Use It
Once deployed, you will:
1.  Go to `https://bestseller-author-pro.vercel.app/setup-supabase`
2.  Paste your **Project URL** and **Anon Public Key** (from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API).
3.  Click "Save & Reload".
4.  Go to Login and sign in with `admin@bestseller.pro` / `password123`.
