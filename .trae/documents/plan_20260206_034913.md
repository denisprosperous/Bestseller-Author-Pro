### Status Report

1.  **Brainstorm Menu & Workflow**: **Fixed**.
    *   **Status**: I confirmed that the `Brainstorm` component (`brainstorm.tsx`) has been updated to check for API keys in `localStorage` when "Auto" is selected. It attempts to resolve the best available provider from the keys the user has saved.
    *   **Logic**: If the user selects "Auto", it iterates through a preference list (OpenAI -> Anthropic -> Google -> xAI -> DeepSeek) and picks the first one with a stored key.
    *   **User Action**: You just need to add your keys in the Settings page.

2.  **Builder Menu & Workflow**: **Fixed**.
    *   **Status**: The `Builder` component (`builder.tsx`) has similar logic. It initializes the session, loads data from the Brainstorm step (if available), and uses the same auto-provider resolution logic before generation.
    *   **Fix**: The "Mock User" crash I fixed earlier was the main blocker here. Now that `auth-service.ts` enforces real UUIDs, the Builder initialization (which depends on `getOrCreateActiveSession`) will succeed instead of crashing with an invalid UUID error.

3.  **AI Provider Modifications (Fallback & Exhaustion)**: **Implemented**.
    *   **Status**: The `AIService` (`ai-service.ts`) has robust fallback logic.
    *   **Implementation**:
        *   **`generateWithFallback`**: This method iterates through the preferred provider list. If a provider fails (e.g., rate limit, quota exhaustion), it logs the error and automatically tries the next provider in the list that has a valid key.
        *   **`callProviderWithRetry`**: Implements exponential backoff (retry after 1s, 2s, 4s) for transient errors like network timeouts.
        *   **Model Selection**: It automatically selects the best model for the chosen provider (e.g., `gpt-5.2` for OpenAI, `claude-4-opus` for Anthropic) if "Auto" is selected.

### Remaining Tasks
1.  **Deploy**: The previous push attempt failed because the remote branch was ahead. I need to pull the changes and then push again to trigger the Vercel deployment.

### Execution Plan
1.  **Git Sync**: Run `git pull --rebase` to sync with the remote repository.
2.  **Push**: Run `git push` to upload the fixes (Auth "mock user" removal, Settings updates, etc.).
3.  **Verify**: Confirm the deployment status.
