1. **Clean Git History**: Use `git reset` to undo the previous commits that contained the accidental secret file (`.env.check`).
2. **Re-commit & Push**: Commit the clean code (Auth fixes, Settings updates, Env config) without the secret file and push to GitHub to trigger Vercel deployment.
3. **Database Instructions**: Provide the user with the content of `database/setup-corrected.sql` and instructions to run it in the Supabase Dashboard to fix the missing tables.
