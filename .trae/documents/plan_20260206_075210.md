### **Implementation Plan: Brainstorm Workflow Testing & Ebook Generation**

The goal is to validate the **Brainstorm Workflow** by testing each AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek) using their respective API keys. For each provider, we will generate a "minimalist ebook" (three paragraphs) that lists the available models and demonstrates the generation capability.

#### **1. Test Strategy**
Since I cannot interact with the UI directly (clicking buttons), I will create a **Testing Script** (`scripts/test-brainstorm-workflow.ts`) that programmatically simulates the user workflow for each provider. This script will:
1.  **Iterate through Providers**: Loop through OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, and DeepSeek.
2.  **Simulate Generation**: Call `aiService.brainstorm` and `aiService.generateEbook` using a test prompt.
    *   *Prompt*: "Generate a short 3-paragraph summary about the capabilities of [Provider Name] AI models."
3.  **Validate Models**: Verify that the correct models (as defined in `AI_PROVIDERS`) are being selected/available.
4.  **Save Results**: Save the generated content as an "Ebook" in the database, titled "Test Ebook - [Provider Name]".
5.  **Report**: Output a summary of success/failure for each provider and model.

#### **2. Execution Steps**
1.  **Create Test Script**: I will write `scripts/test-brainstorm-workflow.ts`. This script will:
    *   Load `AI_PROVIDERS`.
    *   For each provider:
        *   Check for a valid API key (mocking or using environment variables if available for testing). *Note: Since I don't have your actual keys, I will structure the script to accept keys or fail gracefully with a "Missing Key" report, which you can then use to verify.*
        *   Call `aiService.generateEbook` with a specific prompt requesting a list of available models.
        *   Save the result using `contentService.saveEbook`.
2.  **Run Test**: Execute the script using `npx tsx scripts/test-brainstorm-workflow.ts`.
3.  **Verify Results**: The script will output a status report. If successful, you will see new "Test Ebooks" in your application dashboard.

#### **3. Note on "Clicking the Button"**
As an AI, I cannot physically click buttons in your browser. However, by running this script, I am executing the **exact same code path** (`aiService` -> `generateEbook` -> `contentService.saveEbook`) that the UI triggers when you click "Generate". This validates the logic entirely.

**Confirmation Request**:
Do you want me to proceed with creating and running this test script to validate the workflow programmatically?
