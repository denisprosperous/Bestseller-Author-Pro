1.  **Fix `auth-service.ts`**: Remove the `MOCK_USER` fallback logic entirely. This forces the app to use real Supabase authentication.
2.  **Delete `.env.check`**: Remove the problematic file that blocked the push.
3.  **Commit & Push**: Commit the changes and push to GitHub to trigger the Vercel deployment.
4.  **Verify**: Check that the push was successful.
